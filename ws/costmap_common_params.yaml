"Overwrite" simply overwrites the data below, i.e. they are not used. "Maximum" is what you want most of the times. It takes the maximum of what is supplied in the obstacle_layer or the incoming data. "Nothing" doesn't change the incoming data at all. Note that this highly influences how the costmap behaves, depending on your setting of track_unkown_space.
